# Serverbot
My bot I use to control my minecraft server using Python through Discord.
If anyone actually stumbles upon this online and wants to use it for your own server, please make sure you run the .py script using either Command Prompt or Powershell as administrator.
If you use Linux, you probably already know what to do.
Be sure to add your own Bot key and directory to ensure it actually runs.

All so we can control it without having access to the computer running the server / having an admin on the server or having to SSH into the server.

# Commands
Use !start to start the server

Use !stop to stop the server

Use !restart to restart the server

!whitelist_add (playername) to whitelist a player

!ban (playername) to ban a player

!unban (playername) to unban a player.


# TODO
  - Add embeds. (make it look prettier)
  - Work on bug fixes and compatibility issues.
  - Add more commands.
