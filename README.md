# Serverbot
My bot I use to control my minecraft server using Python through Discord.
If anyone actually stumbles upon this online and wants to use it for your own server, please make sure you run the .py script using either Command Prompt or Powershell as administrator.
If you use Linux, you probably already know what to do.
Be sure to add your own Bot key and directory to ensure it actually runs.
